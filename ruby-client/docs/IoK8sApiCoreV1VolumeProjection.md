**cluster_trust_bundle** | [**IoK8sApiCoreV1ClusterTrustBundleProjection**](IoK8sApiCoreV1ClusterTrustBundleProjection.md) | ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the &#x60;.spec.trustBundle&#x60; field of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.  Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.  ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the combination of signer name and a label selector.  Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order over time. | [optional]
